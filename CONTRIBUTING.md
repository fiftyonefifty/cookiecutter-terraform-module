# Contributing

## Contribution Process

### 1. Create your feature branch

```bash
git checkout -b my-new-feature
```

### 2. Commit your changes

If you have multiple commits, squash merge them into a single commit. This helps keep the history light. [Here's a nice guide](https://www.devroom.io/2011/07/05/git-squash-your-latests-commits-into-one/).

```bash
git commit -am 'Added some feature'
```

### 3. Create a Pull Request
